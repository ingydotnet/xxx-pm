NAME
    XXX - See Your Data in the Nude

SYNOPSIS
        use XXX;
        XXX my $dog = Dog->new({has => ['fleas', 'style']});
        my $dog = XXX Dog->new({has => ['fleas', 'style']});
        my $dog = Dog->new(XXX {has => ['fleas', 'style']});
        my $dog = Dog->new({XXX has => ['fleas', 'style']});
        my $dog = Dog->new({has => XXX ['fleas', 'style']});
        my $dog = Dog->new({has => [XXX 'fleas', 'style']});

DESCRIPTION
    XXX.pm exports a function called XXX that you can put just about
    anywhere in your Perl code to make it die with a YAML dump of the
    arguments to its right.

    The charm of XXX-debugging is that it is easy to type, rarely requires
    parens and stands out visually so that you remember to remove it.

    XXX.pm also exports WWW, YYY and ZZZ which do similar debugging things.

FUNCTIONS
    WWW WWW will warn a dump of its arguments, and then return the original
        arguments. This means you can stick it in the middle of expressions.

        NOTE: If you use WWW with Test::More, it will <diag()> rather than
        "warn()".

        mnemonic: W for warn

    XXX XXX will die with a dump of its arguments.

        mnemonic: XXX == Death, Nudity

    YYY YYY will print a dump of its arguments, and then return the original
        arguments. This means you can stick it in the middle of expressions.

        NOTE: If you use YYY with Test::More, it will <note()> rather than
        "print()".

        mnemonic: YYY == Why Why Why??? or YAML YAML YAML

    ZZZ ZZZ will Carp::confess a dump of its arguments.

        mnemonic: You should confess all your sins before you sleep.
        zzzzzzzz

CONFIGURATION
    By default, XXX uses YAML.pm to dump your data. You can change this like
    so:

        use XXX -with => 'Data::Dumper';
        use XXX -with => 'YAML::XS';
        use XXX -with => 'YAML::SomeOtherYamlModule';

    Only modules with names beginning with 'YAML' and the Data::Dumper
    module are supported.

    If you need to load XXX with "require", you can set the dumper module
    with the $XXX::DumpModule global variable.

        require XXX;
        $XXX::DumpModule = 'YAML::Syck';
    
        XXX::XXX($variable);

STACK TRACE LEVEL
    If you call a debugging function that calls XXX for you, XXX will print
    the wrong file and line number. To force XXX to skip a package in the
    call stack, just define the "XXX_skip" constant like this:

        package MyDebugger;
        use constant XXX_skip => 1;
        sub debug {
            require XXX;
            XXX::XXX(@_);
        }

    Now calls to MyDebugger::debug will print the file name you called it
    from, not from MyDebugger itself.
